## Why TinyIce?

Traditional streaming servers can be complex to configure and resource-heavy. TinyIce aims to solve this by providing:

-   **Massive Scalability**: Built with a **Shared Circular Buffer** architecture that allows a single stream to be broadcast to hundreds of thousands of listeners with near-zero memory allocations.
-   **Instant Deployment**: A single binary with all assets (templates, icons, frontend) embedded.
-   **Zero-Config Security**: Unique secure credentials automatically generated on first run.
-   **Multi-Tenant Ready**: Create multiple admin users who can only manage their own mount points.
-   **Edge-Ready Relaying**: Pull streams from other servers with automatic reconnection and in-stream ICY metadata parsing.
-   **Secure & Hardened**: Salted **bcrypt** password hashing, rate limiting, and HTTP resource hardening.
-   **Auto-HTTPS**: Built-in support for **ACME (Let's Encrypt)** for zero-configuration SSL certificates. Supports custom ACME CAs (e.g., Step-CA) for homelab environments.
-   **Real-time Insights**: SSE-powered dashboards with live traffic charts.
-   **Playback History**: Persistent song history stored in a lightweight SQLite database.
-   **Observability**: Built-in **Prometheus** metrics endpoint and structured logging.

## Features

### Streaming & Protocols
-   **Icecast2 Compatible**: Works with standard source clients (BUTT, OBS, Mixxx, LadioCast) and players (VLC, web browsers).
-   **WebRTC Source & Playback**: Ultra-low-latency browser-based broadcasting and listening via the Go Live page.
-   **High-Performance Distribution**: Shared circular buffer architecture designed for 100,000+ concurrent listeners per stream.
-   **Instant Start**: Listeners receive a 64KB audio burst upon connection, eliminating the "buffering" delay.
-   **Built-in Transcoding**: Pure Go transcoding (MP3/Opus) to provide multiple quality options from a single source. No FFmpeg required.
-   **Edge Relaying**: Pull streams from upstream servers with automatic reconnection.
-   **Smart Fallback & Auto-Recovery**: Automatically switch listeners to a backup stream if the primary drops.
-   **Outbound ICY Metadata**: Injects song titles into the audio stream for traditional radio players.
-   **Playlist Support**: `.m3u8`, `.m3u`, and `.pls` playlists for VLC, Winamp, mobile apps.
-   **HLS Output**: Automatic HLS segmentation for each mount point.

### AutoDJ
-   **Multi-Instance Orchestration**: Multiple independent AutoDJs on different mounts from a single server.
-   **Precision Pacing**: Frame-accurate bitstream pacing ensures file-based streams behave exactly like live broadcasts.
-   **Studio Interface**: Full 3-column studio view with library browser, transport controls, visualizer, and playlist management.
-   **Smart Shuffle & Queue**: Priority queue, shuffle mode, loop mode, and drag-to-reorder.
-   **MPD Protocol Support**: Per-instance Music Player Daemon for remote control via standard MPD clients.
-   **Dynamic Metadata**: Automatic ID3 tag extraction and real-time ICY metadata injection.

-   **Full Branding**: Customize site name, tagline, accent color (with visual picker), logo upload, and landing page content (full Markdown support).
-   **Settings**: Server configuration, HTTPS, directory listing, auto-update toggles.

### API & Developer Experience
-   **REST API**: Full JSON API for all management operations (streams, autodj, relays, transcoders, users, security, branding, settings, stats).
-   **Bearer Token Auth**: Create API access tokens in the admin panel for scripts, CI/CD, and external integrations. Tokens support optional expiry and track last-used time/IP.
-   **Session Auth**: Standard cookie-based session authentication via login form.
-   **No CSRF for API**: JSON API requests are inherently CSRF-safe — no token management needed for API consumers.
-   **Interactive API Docs**: Built-in Swagger UI at `/api/docs` with full OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
-   **OpenAPI Spec**: Downloadable at `/api/openapi.yaml` for code generation and client libraries.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install (Pre-built Binary)

```bash
# Download latest release
curl -LJO "https://github.com/DatanoiseTV/tinyice/releases/latest/download/tinyice-$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-$(uname -m)"

# Make executable
chmod +x tinyice-*
mv tinyice-* tinyice

# Run
./tinyice
```

### 2. Build from Source

Requires Go 1.21+ and Node.js 18+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DatanoiseTV/tinyice.git
cd tinyice

# Full build (frontend + Go binary)
make build

# Or manually:
go generate ./server/...   # Rebuild frontend
go build -o tinyice .
```

### 3. First Run

On first run, TinyIce generates `tinyice.json` and prints secure credentials:

```
  FIRST RUN: SECURE CREDENTIALS GENERATED
  Admin Password:  your_admin_password_here
  Default Source Password: your_source_password_here
  Live Mount Password:   your_livemount_password_here
```

**Save these passwords!** Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### 4. Stream

Point your encoder (BUTT, OBS, Mixxx) to:
-   **Server Type**: Icecast 2
-   **Address**: your-server-ip
-   **Port**: 8000
-   **Password**: [The generated source password]
-   **Mount**: /live

Or use the **Go Live** page in the admin panel to broadcast directly from your browser via WebRTC.

## API Usage

### Authentication

Two methods are supported:

**Session cookie** — Log in via the web UI or `POST /login`.

**Bearer token** — Create a token in the admin panel at `/admin/tokens`, then use it in API requests:

```bash
# Create a token in the admin UI, then:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ti_your_token_here" http://localhost:8000/api/stats
```

### Example API Calls

```bash
TOKEN="ti_your_token_here"

# List streams
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/streams

# Create a mount
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mount": "/radio", "password": "secret"}' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/streams

# Get server stats
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/stats

# List AutoDJ instances
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/autodj
```

### Interactive API Docs
