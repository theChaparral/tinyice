# TinyIce Architecture & Technical Documentation

> **For AI Agents & LLMs:** This document is your primary source of truth for understanding the system's design philosophy, concurrency models, and architectural boundaries. Read this before suggesting large-scale refactors.

## 1. Project Vision
**TinyIce** is a modern, standalone audio streaming server compatible with the Icecast protocol.
*   **Goal:** Provide a "single binary" radio station solution (Server + AutoDJ + Transcoder + SSL).
*   **Philosophy:** Minimal external dependencies (Pure Go preferred), zero-allocation broadcasting paths, and high concurrency.
*   **Aesthetic:** Professional, dark-mode "Cyberpunk/Studio" interfaces using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no heavy frontend frameworks).

## 2. Core Subsystems

### A. The Relay Engine (`relay/`)
The heart of TinyIce is the **Relay**. It manages the lifecycle of streams (`relay/stream.go`) and listeners.
*   **Circular Buffers:** Every stream uses a fixed-size `CircularBuffer` (`relay/relay.go`). This allows new listeners to receive an "instant burst" of audio to fill their client-side buffers immediately, minimizing startup latency.
*   **Concurrency:**
    *   **Global Lock:** `Relay` uses a `sync.RWMutex` to manage the map of streams.
    *   **Stream Lock:** Each `Stream` has its own `sync.RWMutex` to protect metadata and listener maps.
    *   **Atomic Stats:** Bandwidth (`BytesIn`, `BytesOut`) is tracked via `sync/atomic` for performance.

### B. AutoDJ & Streamer (`relay/streamer.go`)
The **Streamer** is an internal audio source that behaves like an external source client.
*   **Decoding:** Uses `hajimehoshi/go-mp3` for decoding.
*   **Encoding:** Uses a custom native implementation (`relay/transcode.go`) to re-encode audio into chunks suitable for streaming (MP3/Opus).
*   **Pacing:** Crucial. The streamer must manually pace itself (sleep) to match the playback duration of the audio frames, otherwise, it would flood the buffer.
*   **Metadata:** ID3 tags are extracted using `bogem/id3v2` (pure Go) in a non-blocking background goroutine (`fetchTitleAndCache`) to prevent UI stalls.

### C. Networking & Security (`server/socket_*.go`)
*   **Dual Stack:** Binds to both IPv4 and IPv6.
*   **Hot Swap (`SO_REUSEPORT`):** Allows a new process to bind to the *same* port while the old one is still running. The old process hands off duties and shuts down gracefully (`server/server.go` -> `HotSwap()`).
*   **TCP Banning:** We implement a `BannedListener` wrapper that drops connections from banned IPs at the `Accept()` level, before any TLS or HTTP overhead is incurred.

### D. Web Interface (`server/templates/`)
*   **Technology:** Server-Side Rendered (SSR) Go templates + Vanilla JS.
*   **Real-time:** Uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** (`/admin/events`) to push JSON state updates (listeners, current song, VU meters) to the frontend.
*   **Studio UI:** A specific focus on "app-like" behavior using AJAX forms (`submitForm`) to avoid full page reloads during broadcast operations.
*   **Go Live Studio:** Enables direct browser-to-server streaming using WebAudio API.
    *   **WebRTC Mode:** Uses `pion/webrtc` for ultra-low latency Opus streaming.
    *   **HTTP Fallback:** Uses `MediaRecorder` to stream chunks via POST requests.

## 4. Key Data Flows

### A. AutoDJ Playback
1.  `StreamerManager` selects a file from `Playlist` or `Queue`.
2.  File is decoded to PCM.
3.  Transcoder (`EncodeMP3`/`EncodeOpus`) converts PCM to streaming chunks.
4.  Chunks are written to the `Stream.Buffer`.
5.  `Stream.Broadcast` signals all waiting Listener goroutines via channels.

### B. WebRTC Source (Go Live)
1.  Browser captures microphone via `getUserMedia`.
2.  Opus packets are sent via WebRTC `TrackRemote`.
3.  `WebRTCManager` receives RTP packets and uses `oggwriter` to mux them into Ogg pages.
4.  The resulting Ogg data is written directly to the `Stream.Buffer` for distribution.

### C. Listener Connection
1.  `handleListener` (`server/server.go`) accepts HTTP request.
2.  `Stream.Subscribe` registers the listener and returns a buffer offset (rewound by `burst_size`).
3.  The listener loop reads from the `CircularBuffer` starting at that offset.
4.  Loop waits on a signal channel for new data to arrive.

## 5. Future Roadmap & Missing Features

If you are an AI agent looking to contribute, focus on these areas:

### High Priority (functionality)
1.  **Scheduler:** The AutoDJ needs a time-based scheduler (e.g., "Play 'Jazz' playlist every Friday at 8 PM").
2.  **Jingles/Sweepers:** A mechanism to inject short audio files (station IDs) between tracks or every $N$ songs.
3.  **Live Mic Injection:** Integrate `pion/webrtc` more deeply to allow "Go Live" directly from the browser (WebRTC -> Opus -> Internal Buffer mix).
4.  **S3/MinIO Support:** Allow the AutoDJ to stream files directly from object storage instead of the local filesystem (cloud-native scaling).

### Medium Priority (UX/Polish)
1.  **Visualizer:** A server-side or client-side FFT visualizer in the Studio.
2.  **Request System:** A public-facing widget where listeners can request songs from the library (with rate limiting).
3.  **OIDC/OAuth:** Support for logging in via GitHub/Google/OIDC instead of just Basic Auth/Cookies.

### Architecture Improvements
1.  **HLS/DASH Support:** Currently only supports progressive HTTP (Icecast). Adding HLS would improve mobile compatibility.
2.  **Clustering:** Allow multiple TinyIce nodes to share state/streams (Relay-chaining is already supported, but shared state is not).
